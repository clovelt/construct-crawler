## Important

Changes made by this app cannot be undone. Make sure to back up your project before using this app.

# Contributing

This project uses Tauri + Vue 3 + Vite. It is recommended to be somewhat familiar with these technologies before contributing.

## Getting Started

First, create an issue describing the feature you want to add or the bug you want to fix. This will allow us to discuss the implementation details before you start working on it.
Even if you don't plan on contributing code, you can still create an issue to discuss a feature or bug.

Once you have an issue, you can start working on it. Fork the repository and clone it to your local machine. Then, run `npm install` to install the dependencies and `npm run tauri dev` to start the development server.

When you are done, create a pull request and reference the issue you created in the description.
